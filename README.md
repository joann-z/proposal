## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

2048 Game.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

2048 is a game involving blocks with the power of 2 on a 4x4 grid. The goal of the game is to merge enough blocks to get 2048 blocks.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The goal of the game 2048 is to merge all the blocks in the power of 2 to get 2048 blocks. Once each moves, one new block appears. If there are no more blocks able to be combined, the user will lose. But the user obtains the 2048 blocks the user wins. We will be using Pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Sydney Kimbell, tum99567@temple.edu TA: Joanne Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The 2048 game will have a functable grid where the user is able to move around.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For a better outcome. The 2048 game will have graphics and look somewhat appealing. The game will be able to detect when the user has not moved and when the user collects 2048 blocks to win.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For a best outcome. The 2048 game will be fully functable with input from the arrow keys. The game will accumulate xp when 2 blocks are combined. When the game ends the screen will display a 'win' or 'lose'.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To start the 2048 game, the two main things we need are GUI interfaces and metrix/linear algebra logic. Because the game board is a matrix. Most of the logic of the game uses linear algebra. We will need to know how to use a multidimensional arrays/lists. We plan to use Pygame to create graphics. We need to researc the function of Pygame. To divide up the work. Me and Sydney Kimbell will focus on creating the logic of the game. Corinne will focus on creating graphs and learning Pygame functions. We will all debug and compile the code to make sure it functions.
